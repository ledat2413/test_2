# payment_gateways_app

 Payment Demo application is built on the following elements:

1. Architectural: Clean Architecture + Modularization
- To ensure maintainability and scalability, I will use Clean Architecture + Modularization. This will allow separation and easy exchange or extension of functions.

2. Handling Multiple Payment Gateways
- Since the application needs to support multiple payment gateways (e.g. Stripe, PayPal,...), I will use Dependency Injection and Factory Patterns for payment providers.

3. Supporting Multiple Authentication Methods
- This application will support Authentication features such as: Email & Password Authentication, Firebase Sign-In, Facebook Sign-In, Google Sign-In,...

4. Integrating Third-Party Services
- The application can connect to Firebase, Push Notifications,

5. State Management
- There are many ways to manage State, I will use: Provider for dependency injection and state management.

6. Scalability Considerations
- Modular Approach: Feature-based modularization allows for independent development and testing.
- Loose Coupling with Interfaces: New payment gateways, authentication methods, or third-party services can be added with minimal changes.
- Error Handling & Logging: Centralized error handling using CatchError or possibly Firebase Crashlytics.
